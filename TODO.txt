+ a list of games to choose from, and a parameter of the current game chosen that gets saved in the xml file.
+ Icon
+ AboutBox (with credits for Livestreamer team)
+ put on GitHub
+ a link opening the livestream in the browser to support the streamers
+ further testing of a bug where a stream doesn't launch after clicking on play (must be some bug with livestreamer)

+ fix an exception that occurs when you already have a stream list loaded, you change the current game and click OK, the stream list starts loading but you click play, normally play button should be disabled in this case

+ if a quality has been chosen, and we change the stream we check if the previous prefered quality is available so we activate it by default.

- fix an unexpected behavior for when VLC executable is set manually at the startup of the application

- Include stream name

- Ability to subscribe/follow a channel in twitch

- put a condition on Checking of online status, to bypass any non-twitch streams. Possible improvement would be to try to implement an online check for each of the supported streaming services.
